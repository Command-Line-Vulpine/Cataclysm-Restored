# To-Do list

* Add back in robots.  Chicken Walker, Police Bot, Riot Bot, etc.
* Make it so dissecting certain types of zombies yields CBMs again.
* Add back in various types of vending machines and ATMs.
* Add more locations with auto-docs.
* Add back in self-installing CBMs (should be more difficult and dangerous than an autodoc).
* Add turning portal storms back on as a mod.
* Add some way to get the benefits from portal storms without turning them on.
* Check drugs and increase their stat bonuses closer to what they used to be.
* Make loot pools my random, particularly in houses.
* Double check guns an ammo.  Add back in fan favorite weapons that were removed.  Make sure ammo is accessible for rare guns, perhaps via vending machine.
* Simplify crafting.  This would include making rags the majority crafting item for cloth instead of sheets; and removing welding rods for metal working.
* Restore old traits.  Packmule boosting carry volume by 20%, Trigger Happy if possible.
